My name is Kyle Sherman. I have a variety of passions. My site will be a place where I will write different posts relating to each of these different topics. Here is a little bit about me as it relates to each of the topics about which I will write.

You can also check out my new app called [Count It Off](https://countitoff.com) now available [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1439712286?pt=118826831&ct=Kyle-Blog&mt=8).

## Ergonomics
I am very focused on health and wellness. My father is a chiropractor, so I have learned about posture and proper ergonomics throughout my life. During my professional career, I have met with numerous Ergonomists to learn more and ensure that I was working safely. I tend to get migraines and find that improper posture is one cause. I hope to help everyone learn more about proper ergonomics and why it’s so important, especially for people working on a computer for the majority of their day. 

## Software Development
For my full professional history, visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyledsherman). Speaking of which, I currently work for PIX System as an iOS Engineer. Previously I worked at LinkedIn. At LinkedIn, I worked on multiple teams including SlideShare (both Android & iOS), Flagship Feed iOS and now on the iOS Infrastructure team. I've been developing for iOS since the iPhone SDK was first announced in 2008. I currently write all of my code in Swift and have used it since day 1 of the language's release.

I have released a few different apps on the App Store, though none are currently for sale as I have discontinued them. I continue to work on side projects. You can find one of my side projects on GitHub: [Music Notation Kit](https://www.github.com/drumnkyle/music-notation-kit). 

I have a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Rutgers University in New Jersey. 

## Music
I play guitar, bass, drums, and a little bit of piano. I started playing drums when I was 2 years old and guitar and bass when I was 10 years old. I enjoy listening to and playing classic rock, blues, jazz, and soul/funk. Currently, I play drums in NextPlay, the LinkedIn band, and play open jam sessions around the San Francisco Bay Area. I have played professionally off and on. If you’re interested in playing music in the area, let me know. 

## Teaching
Another passion of mine is teaching. I love helping people. Teaching allows me to have a direct impact on peoples’ lives by helping them learn new skills. I have taught guitar in both group and private lessons. I have also taught private drum lessons. I authored a [video course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-layouttest-for-ios-development) for the LinkedIn Learning Platform teaching [LayoutTest](https://github.com/linkedin/LayoutTest-iOS), which is an open source iOS testing library created at LinkedIn.
