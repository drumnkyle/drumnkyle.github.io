Since movement is most important to proper function , staying in a static position can be tiring. We all tend to slouch when in an unsupported position for a long period of time like sitting or standing still at a desk. This is natural and not something for which you should be ashamed. The best way to combat this is to be supported and/or not static for a long period of time. However, many jobs require us to be sitting or standing at a desk for most of the work day.

Proper posture is very important to have proper function of all the systems in your body. The spine houses your spinal cord, which is the central nervous system. The central nervous system controls all other systems in the body. When you have incorrect posture, it can lead to spinal problems, which can pinching of the spinal cord, causing incorrect messages being sent throughout your nervous system. By maintaining proper posture we can make sure we are not causing spinal problems. 

To help with this issue, all we really need is a gentle reminder to maintain good posture throughout the day. There are many devices that forcibly move your spine into proper posture, but that doesn't help your muscles get used to keeping proper posture. The [Lumo Lift](https://www.lumobodytech.com/lumo-lift/ "Lumo Lift") is a fantastic device to give you gentle reminders throughout the day to keep your posture correct.  You wear the small device near your collarbone, and it will gently vibrate if you slouch for longer than a specified amount of time, which you can adjust; I recommend 30 seconds. 

This device retails for $99 and sometimes goes on sale. It is very much worth it! I have worn mine almost every day since I purchased it during their preorder campaign in first part of 2014. After about a year of wearing this device and regularly seeing a chiropractor, when I had a new X-Ray to see my progress, my head had moved 10 degrees back towards being centered over my body. This quite a large change!

Check out the Lumo Lift for yourself. It's a fantastic device and well worth the price.
