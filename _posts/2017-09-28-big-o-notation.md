I just wanted to share a [quick link](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vernon/cs367/notes/3.COMPLEXITY.html#youtry3) with everyone that I believe explains Big-O notation pretty well and has nice little self-tests with solutions. Big-O notation is very necessary for technical phone interviews, but it can also be very helpful when developing solutions in your work. I hope the link above helps you understand Big-O notation better; it helped me when I was learning it.
